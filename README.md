# sioValleyFoods 'ecommerce' application :+1:

### I have an idea of making an on-line ecommerce that is cross-platform, this so because my cousin makes his own vegan foods that people love and he does the deliveries by himself, and he is growing, meaning in future he will need a platform and i want to make it for him as soon as now.

- [x] Have tried in the above commit, so far (and)
- [ ] I want to know how to make an API
- [ ] Get help from you on how to build on this Idea.
